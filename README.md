# Auditor
## An attempt at collecting and publishing data for groups within an organization. 
Annual and quarterly audits are common in many organizations. To make this *somewhat* easier, this script will fetch, parse, and publish data based on needs I have discovered. However, I have intended to make it as portable and resuable with as little refactoring as possible.

## To run
``
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
``
