# Auditor
## An attempt at collecting and publishing data for groups within an organization.

### Summary
Annual and quarterly audits are common in many organizations. To make this somewhat easier, this script will fetch, parse, and publish data based on needs I have discovered. Though I have intended to make it as portable and resuable as possible, it currently focuses on fetching organizational data from GitHub.

## To run
`` virtualenv -p python3 venv``

``source venv/bin/activate``

``pip install -r requirements.txt``
